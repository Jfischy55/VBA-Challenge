VBA-Challenge assignment 2 for Data Analytics Boot Camp

I got the initial ticker aspect of the assignment completed but wasn't able to fix the code for the next few steps. 

I kept running into issues not getting my results to populate in the desired cells.

I tried looking at a couple different people's codes online to fix my issues, but ended up making it even worse and not sure how to fix it now.

I also don't have any more time to work on the assignment, getting ready for a wedding and will be missing class tomorrow.

Figure I might as well submit what I have though it isn't much and doesn't fully work.

I'll list the two sources I used to attempt to complete the assignment below.
